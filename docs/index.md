# audiocube

Software toolbox for a few similar devices I call "audio cubes": More or less cube-shaped audio players with an integrated speaker, that will automatically start playing fairytales from their internal memory when one of the affiliated figures (containing a hidden NFC tag) is placed on top of the device. All devices seen so for use audio files with a `.smp` extension.

## Alternatives

- [smp2mp3](https://github.com/ZapDissaster/smp2mp3/) by ZapDissaster is a very similar software tool with a GUI for Windows, that is probably easier to get running for Windows users who have little experience with using command-line tools
